# hello-world
I have worked on many hands on project in the cybersecurity field including but not limited to:
security audit,
analysing network structure and security,
using linux commands to manage file permissions,
applying filters to SQL queries, 
identifying vulnerabilities for a small business,
documenting incidents with an incident handler's journal,
importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenerio.
I used some general and technical skills and accomplishing this tasks including:python,SQL,linux, frameworks like NIST CSF etc.
I am still hoping to expand my knowledge in the cybersecurity field by participating in hackathons and taking more exams in the cyber security field.
